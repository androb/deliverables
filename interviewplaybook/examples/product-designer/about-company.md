Tiny Technologies, the company behind TinyMCE, is a leading provider of open-source and premium paid rich text editing solutions. The company's mission is to make content creation globally accessible, and it does this through its flagship product, TinyMCE, which is used by developers worldwide to embed advanced rich text editing capabilities within applications[1][6]. 

Tiny's vision is to streamline digital transformation by delivering scalable, out-of-the-box rich text editing capabilities. This vision is driven by the belief that there is a substantial market for tools that help developers accelerate their rate of innovation[6]. 

The company's values are reflected in its culture, which is described as "WYSIWYG" (What You See Is What You Get). This means that the company is transparent, honest, and straightforward in its dealings. Tiny is a remote-first company, prioritizing work-life balance over long commutes. The company also values learning and growth, providing its team members with opportunities for development and supporting them in reaching their career goals[1]. 

Tiny also values diversity, with more than a dozen nations represented in its team. The company encourages change and promotes points of progress both internally and amongst its community. It has mechanisms and processes for handling feedback, encouraging teams to speak up, and making adjustments based on insights shared[3]. 

TinyMCE was created to improve the productivity of developers by eliminating the need to develop and maintain an in-house rich text editor. This allows developers to focus on ensuring their own product is market-leading. While TinyMCE primarily supports developers, it also helps end-users – content creators – by making their editing experience as familiar and as simple as possible[7]. 

In summary, Tiny Technologies is a company that is committed to making content creation globally accessible, streamlining digital transformation, and fostering a culture of transparency, learning, and growth.
