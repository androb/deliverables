<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Interview Playbook is a comprehensive resource for evaluating
candidates for the Medical Assistant II role at Pacific Wellness Group.
It provides a clear structure for the interview process, specifying the
technical and behavioral competencies required for the position. The
guideâ€™s purpose is to enable objective and thorough candidate
evaluations, ensuring they meet the high standards of patient care and
organizational culture at Pacific Wellness Group.</p>
<h3 id="interview-structure">Interview Structure</h3>
<p>The interview for the Medical Assistant II position will take place
over a 60 to 90-minute session and will be conducted in several parts to
ensure a comprehensive assessment of both technical and behavioral
competencies.</p>
<p>The interview will begin with an introduction and rapport-building
phase, lasting approximately 10 minutes, to put the candidate at ease.
This will be followed by a technical assessment, which will comprise
around 30 minutes of the interview time, where candidates will be
questioned on clinical procedures, medical knowledge, technical
communication, BLS competency, and computer and technical skills.</p>
<p>Next, we will move into the behavioral assessment, another 30
minutes, where we will explore service excellence, team collaboration,
professional development, ethical practice &amp; integrity, and
organizational skills. These assessments will deeply probe the
candidateâ€™s ability to integrate with Pacific Wellness Groupâ€™s values
and operating principles.</p>
<p>The session will end with a Q&amp;A period allowing candidates to ask
questions and understand more about our organization and their potential
role within it. This will account for the remaining time and should not
exceed 10 minutes. Throughout the interview, we will systematically
cover key competencies and ensure that the candidate has the opportunity
to demonstrate their abilities relevant to the role.</p>
