# Interview Guide for Infrastructure Software Engineer

## About this Guide

Welcome to this strategic guide to streamline and enhance the interview process for the position of Infrastructure Software Engineer. 
This document serves as a comprehensive resource for hiring teams, ensuring a structured, efficient, and effective evaluation of candidates. 
Through structured interviewing, our aim is to identify a candidate who not only possesses the necessary technical skills and experience but also aligns with 
Y Combinator's values and culture. 

The playbook outlines a clear structure for the interview process, including a detailed assessment of key competencies, practical assignments, and behavioral insights. 
Through this approach, we aspire to understand each candidate's potential and ensure the best fit for both the role and Y Combinator.

The guide includes both behavioral and situational interview questions. We recommend dividing up competencies and questions between two or three interviewers
and using a combination of both types to assess a candidate's suitability for the role. 

- **Behavioral** questions are based on the premise that past behavior predicts future performance. These questions prompt candidates to recount specific 
past experiences, focusing on their actions and outcomes. They are effective for roles where past experience is a strong indicator of success, 
especially in skills like problem-solving and leadership. For example, asking "Describe a time when you worked under a tight deadline" assesses 
time management and pressure handling.

- **Situational** questions are hypothetical and designed to assess how candidates might handle future situations. They test judgment and problem-solving 
abilities, asking candidates to respond to imaginary scenarios. These questions are useful for evaluating less experienced candidates or roles 
requiring adaptability. An example is, "How would you handle a project falling behind schedule?" which gauges analytical thinking and adaptability.

Both behavioral and situational questions are valuable in interviews 
but serve different purposes. Behavioral questions are best for roles where past experience predicts success, while situational questions 
suit roles requiring future problem-solving and adaptability. A combination of both types offers a comprehensive assessment of a candidate's capabilities.

This interview guide was created by [Deliverables AI](https://www.deliverables.ai) using GPT-4 and is based on the job description and company description provided.
It should be used in conjunction with an interviewer's expertise and knowledge of the domain to assess the candidate's suitability for the role. 
Research shows that structured interviews are significantly more effective and less biased at identifying successful future employees and we welcome any 
feedback you have to [feedback@deliverables.ai](mailto:feedback@deliverables.ai).

## Y Combinator Mission, Vision, and Values

### Mission

Y Combinator's mission is to increase the number of startups by assisting founders in their creation. The organization aims to get startups through their initial phase, often helping them build something impressive enough to raise significant amounts of money on a larger scale.

### Vision

Y Combinator envisions a world where startups are the norm rather than the exception. They believe that startups are, on balance, a good thing, as their founders and early employees can be much more productive than they would be working for an established company. Y Combinator's vision is to apply mass production techniques to startup funding, making the process more efficient and beneficial for founders.

### Values

Y Combinator values integrity, respect, and accountability. They believe these traits are critical for founders to possess. The organization is built on a network of trust, with its strength and value hinging on the trustworthiness of its members. Unethical behavior is not tolerated, as it puts the reputation of the entire community at risk. Y Combinator also values the idea of putting the founders' interests first, even before their own. This approach, while seemingly counterintuitive in a for-profit business, has proven to be more scalable and beneficial in the long run.

Y Combinator also values evidence of demand for a startup's solution and the strength of the founding team. They believe in the importance of launching and testing ideas quickly, rather than overplanning or overthinking. This approach is based on the understanding that the market and user needs can change rapidly, and startups need to be agile and responsive to these changes.

In summary, Y Combinator's mission, vision, and values revolve around fostering a supportive and ethical environment for startups, promoting efficiency and productivity, and encouraging quick action and responsiveness to market demands.
