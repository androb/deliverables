# Innovate Accelerator Mission, Vision, and Values

## Mission

Innovate Accelerator's mission is to increase the number of startups by assisting founders in their creation. The organization aims to get startups through their initial phase, often helping them build something impressive enough to raise significant amounts of money on a larger scale.

## Vision

Innovate Accelerator envisions a world where startups are the norm rather than the exception. They believe that startups are, on balance, a good thing, as their founders and early employees can be much more productive than they would be working for an established company. Innovate Accelerator's vision is to apply mass production techniques to startup funding, making the process more efficient and beneficial for founders.

## Values

Innovate Accelerator values integrity, respect, and accountability. They believe these traits are critical for founders to possess. The organization is built on a network of trust, with its strength and value hinging on the trustworthiness of its members. Unethical behavior is not tolerated, as it puts the reputation of the entire community at risk. C Combinator also values the idea of putting the founders' interests first, even before their own. This approach, while seemingly counterintuitive in a for-profit business, has proven to be more scalable and beneficial in the long run.

Innovate Accelerator also values evidence of demand for a startup's solution and the strength of the founding team. They believe in the importance of launching and testing ideas quickly, rather than overplanning or overthinking. This approach is based on the understanding that the market and user needs can change rapidly, and startups need to be agile and responsive to these changes.

In summary, Innovate Accelerator's mission, vision, and values revolve around fostering a supportive and ethical environment for startups, promoting efficiency and productivity, and encouraging quick action and responsiveness to market demands.
