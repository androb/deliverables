## Job Description

**Y Combinator - Infrastructure Software Engineer**

Y Combinator is seeking an Infrastructure Software Engineer who will help manage and evolve the shared infrastructure that our software runs on. We have a team of approximately 15 Product Engineers who develop YC’s software products. Those products are developed in Ruby on Rails and run in AWS. Our team’s job is to provide a platform so our Product Engineers don’t have to think (as much) about infrastructure.

The ideal candidate will have experience debugging and developing a very broad stack. They’re comfortable talking about HTTP caching, AWS security groups, Rails monkey patching, n+1 queries in Active Record, CSRF protection, and React components.

Enjoy the many perks of working for a successful company – competitive salary and excellent benefits including fully-paid health care benefits and unlimited vacation – while working on a small, fast-moving and high-impact team.

In your first month, you might:

- Migrate a Rails application from Capistrano and EC2 to Docker and ECS
- Upgrade one of our applications to a newer version of Postgres or Rails
- Move more of our AWS infrastructure into Terraform
- Simplify our use of Webpack and Javascript for both developer productivity and faster deployments
- Create shared infrastructure to help manage email subscriptions and unsubscribes across 5 different product teams
- Triage and respond to bug bounty reports
- Work with outside security auditors to run a penetration test against our applications

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Provide a stable modern platform for our applications to be deployed to
- Keep our applications and data secure
- Improve our developer experience and tools so the YC Software Team can ship product updates quickly
- Help debug performance issues in our web applications
- Ship Ruby on Rails and TypeScript code that is shared among multiple YC applications

**Skills:**

- You know how to develop and debug MVC web applications. We use Ruby on Rails, Postgres, and React, but don’t worry if you haven’t used those specific technologies before
- You know how to deploy and run applications with AWS and Docker
- You use Terraform to make infrastructure changes

**Experience:**

- You have at least 5 years of experience developing and deploying web applications
- You are deeply familiar with the AWS platform specifically ECS, RDS, IAM, and CloudWatch

**Location:** YC is headquartered in the SF Bay Area with employees working from home or from our offices in San Francisco and Mountain View, CA. Candidates must live in the SF Bay Area or be willing to relocate.

**Compensation:** $130,000 to $270,000 + bonus (depending on skills and experience).

**Benefits:** Our full benefits package includes medical, vision, and dental plans, infertility benefit, STD/LTD, life insurance, commuter benefits, flexible spending account, health savings account, 401(k) + 4% matching, generous parental leave, paid holidays and flexible paid time off policy.

**Work Authorization:** This position does not support work authorization/visa sponsorship.

Y Combinator considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state, and local law including San Francisco’s Fair Chance Ordinance.
