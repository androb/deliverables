<p>At Nixon Peabody, our priority is to attract, retain, and promote talented individuals from a wide range of racial, ethnic, social, economic, religious, and personal backgrounds, genders, and sexual orientations. Therefore, we encourage talented individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences to apply.</p>
<p>More than a third of Nixon Peabody’s lawyers are litigators. We have decades of experience representing clients at every level of the trial and appellate courts in multiple jurisdictions, in international forums, and mediations, arbitrations, and other methods of alternative dispute resolution. </p>
<p>A career at Nixon Peabody is the opportunity to do work that matters. It’s a chance to use your knowledge to shape what’s ahead, to innovate, and to learn at a firm that taps into the power of collaboration and collective thinking. </p>
<p>In accordance with applicable Federal and State laws, the anticipated annual salary range for this position is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>San Francisco, CA: $160,000-$175,000</li>

<p>In addition to a standard benefits package, this role may be eligible for additional contingent compensation based on an array of factors, including but not limited to: work performance, geographic location, work experience, education, and qualifications.
