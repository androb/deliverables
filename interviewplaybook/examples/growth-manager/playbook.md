# Interview Guide for Growth Manager

## About this Guide

Welcome to this strategic guide to streamline and enhance the interview process for the position of Growth Manager. 
This document serves as a comprehensive resource for hiring teams, ensuring a structured, efficient, and effective evaluation of candidates. 
Through structured interviewing, our aim is to identify a candidate who not only possesses the necessary technical skills and experience but also aligns with 
SocialGameCo's values and culture. 

The playbook outlines a clear structure for the interview process, including a detailed assessment of key competencies, practical assignments, and behavioral insights. 
Through this approach, we aspire to understand each candidate's potential and ensure the best fit for both the role and SocialGameCo.

The guide includes both behavioral and situational interview questions. We recommend dividing up competencies and questions between two or three interviewers
and using a combination of both types to assess a candidate's suitability for the role. 

- **Behavioral** questions are based on the premise that past behavior predicts future performance. These questions prompt candidates to recount specific 
past experiences, focusing on their actions and outcomes. They are effective for roles where past experience is a strong indicator of success, 
especially in skills like problem-solving and leadership. For example, asking "Describe a time when you worked under a tight deadline" assesses 
time management and pressure handling.

- **Situational** questions are hypothetical and designed to assess how candidates might handle future situations. They test judgment and problem-solving 
abilities, asking candidates to respond to imaginary scenarios. These questions are useful for evaluating less experienced candidates or roles 
requiring adaptability. An example is, "How would you handle a project falling behind schedule?" which gauges analytical thinking and adaptability.

Both behavioral and situational questions are valuable in interviews 
but serve different purposes. Behavioral questions are best for roles where past experience predicts success, while situational questions 
suit roles requiring future problem-solving and adaptability. A combination of both types offers a comprehensive assessment of a candidate's capabilities.

This interview guide was created by [Deliverables AI](https://www.deliverables.ai) using GPT-4 and is based on the job description and company description provided.
It should be used in conjunction with an interviewer's expertise and knowledge of the domain to assess the candidate's suitability for the role. 
Research shows that structured interviews are significantly more effective and less biased at identifying successful future employees and we welcome any 
feedback you have to [feedback@deliverables.ai](mailto:feedback@deliverables.ai).
